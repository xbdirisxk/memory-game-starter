# Simpsons Memory Game

## How this game works

This game puts your memory to the test. You are presented with multiple images of celebrities. The images get shuffled every-time they are clicked. You CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else your score resets to zero. The main objective is to get the highest score as possible.

## your Assignment
1- fork the repo and then clone it your local enviroment 

2- Take a little bit of time to think about how you want to implement your application, the features you want to implement, which components you need, and how to structure your application. Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a ‚ÄúBest Score‚Äù, which shows the best score you achieved thus far. You also need a couple of cards that display images and possibly informational text. There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.

3- Now that you‚Äôve thought about the structure of your application, set up the folder structure and start creating the components. We suggest you use functional components and therefore hooks in this project.

4- Style your application so you can show it off!
